     <font face="Comic Sans MS"> <font size=2> I think that we should have a knowledge, because we should know that there are limits because if we use the technology without any kind of control could be dangerous for us</font>

              <p>
2) Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?
        
            </p>
            <p>

 We need to be carefully because if we use the technology without any kind of control could be dangerous for us,
 in other part I think that the technology doesn't make us think and anything that we don't know only we look for it in the internet and that's it, and we are not interested in if we learned something or no.

        D.Represent with a symbol the advantage or disadvantage of the technology related to the analyzed chapter and explain it.

         In my opinion the image  show us that In different cases the technology can be an advantage because is more easy to communicate with different people, or for example with the technology now is easiest to go to one side to another. In other part  the technology can be a disadvantage because we are constantly  fighting V.S technology because when we want to leave it we canâ€™t because we feel it necessary for our lives.
